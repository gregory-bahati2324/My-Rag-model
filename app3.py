JUDICIARY 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF TANZANIA 
SONGEA SUB-REGISTRY 
AT SONGEA 
MISCELLANEOUS CRIMINAL APPLICATION NO. 33698 OF 2024 
(Originating from Nyasa District Court in Criminal Case No. 3177 of 2024) 
BRUNO BRUNO MBUNDA …..……...…….……..…..…...………… APPLICANT 
VERSUS 
THE REPUBLIC …….…………...……...…………..……………….. RESPONDENT 
RULING 
08th April & 06th May, 2025.  
KAWISHE, J.: 
The applicant herein above filed before this court an application for 
extension of time within which to file a notice of intention to appeal and a 
petition of appeal out of time. The application has been brought by way of 
chamber summons made under section 361(2) of the Criminal Procedure 
Act (Cap. 20, R.E 2022) and section 14(1) of the Law of Limitation Act 
(Cap. 89, R.E 2019) supported by an affidavit sworn by the applicant.   
1 
The application has been resisted by the Republic/Respondent. When 
the application was called on for hearing, Mr. Augustino Mahenge, learned 
advocate represented the applicant while Mr. Issa Chiputula, learned State 
Attorney appeared for the respondent.  
Submitting on the application, Mr. Augustino Mahenge, prayed for the 
applicant’s affidavit to be adopted to form part of his submission. He 
contended that, reading the contents of the 4th, 6th and 7th paragraphs of 
the affidavit it is clear that the applicant had an intention of pursuing his 
appeal as he filed his notice of intention to appeal on time as shown in 
annexture BM1. He added that, the reasons as to why he failed to file the 
appeal on time are found under paragraphs six and seven, that as a 
prisoner he failed to get legal assistance from the prison’s officer. That, it 
was upon his relatives’ visitation in prison who came to be aware that the 
appeal was not filed hence took an initiative to look for an advocate to 
assist him. That at the time he engaged an advocate, his appeal was 
already out of time and the only way was to file this application for 
extension of time in order to file the appeal. Mr. Mahenge argued that, the 
challenges encountered by prisoners in the prisons have been accepted as 
among the good cause for extension of time. To buttress his stance, he 
2 
cited the case of Said Rashid Semkiwa @ Kangamsee & Another vs 
Republic, Criminal Application No. 60 of 2021. 
In his reply submission, Mr. Issa Chiputula, acknowledged that this 
court has discretionary powers to extend time to file an appeal under the 
provisions of sections 361(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act (supra). 
However, he argued that such power is exercisable upon the applicant 
adducing good cause for the delay. He added that, what amounts to good 
cause is not provided under the law and each case has to be treated on its 
merits. Mr. Chiputula submitted that, in the case of Mbogo vs Shah 
(1968) EACA, the court set conditions to be considered in granting an 
application for extension of time to be; the length of the delay, reasons for 
the delay, existence of an arguable case, the injury that the respondent 
shall suffer if the application is allowed, each day of delay be accounted 
for, the delay should not be inordinate and he should not be negligent in 
pursuing his appeal. He bolstered his submission by citing the case of Ally 
Salum Saidi (Administrator of the Estate of the late Antar Said 
Kleb) vs Iddi Athman Ndaki, Civil Application No. 450/17/2021. 
Mr. Chiputula went on submitting that, in this application the 
applicant’s affidavit bears no good cause to move this court to grant 
3 
extension of time. He amplified that, as submitted by the applicant’s 
learned advocate, the reasons for extension of time are set out at 
paragraph 4, 6 and 7 of the affidavit sworn in support of the application. 
He contended that at paragraph 4 the applicant has submitted that the 
delay was caused by the prison officers’ failure to assist the applicant who 
filed the notice of intention to appeal within time. He added that there is 
no reason stated as to why the applicant filed his notice of intention to 
appeal within time and the failure to file the petition of appeal within 45 
days. Also, he argued that, the applicant has failed to name the prison 
officer who failed to assist him. He averred that the applicant was negligent 
in filing the appeal since the impugned decision was delivered on 19th 
August, 2024 and the time for filing an appeal expired 04th October, 2024, 
but the application was filed on 25th November, 2024 which was fifty days 
later and there is no good cause for the delay. 
The respondent’s counsel submitted further that, the applicant’s 
counsel has failed to pinpoint any illegality in the impugned decision to 
warrant this court to grant the application. He went on arguing that, it is in 
the interest of justice that a case must come into an end and granting the 
present application without sufficient reason will prejudice the respondent. 
4 
He added that, the delay for fifty days is an inordinate delay taking into 
consideration that there is no sufficient reason given by the applicant for 
the delay. On the applicant’s assertion that his relatives visited him in 
prison and went to look for an advocate who assisted him in filing the 
application is not correct for the reason that, the relatives and advocate 
has neither been mentioned nor sworn an affidavit to prove such assertion. 
In respect to the decision made in the case of Said Rashid Semkiwa @ 
Kangamsee & Another vs Republic (supra), he argued that it is 
distinguishable from the instant application due to the fact that in that 
decision the applicant did not even file his notice of intention to appeal 
while in the application at hand the applicant filed the notice of intention to 
appeal and failed to file the appeal. He prayed for the application to be 
dismissed for want of merit. 
In his rejoinder submission, the applicant’s learned counsel averred 
that, in the case of Said Rashid Semkiwa @ Kangamsee & Another 
vs Republic (supra), which he cited in his submission in chief, this court 
referred to the position of the Court of Appeal in the case of Yusuf 
Hassan vs Republic Criminal Application No. 56/12 of 2017 which is 
binding this court too. He contended that, the learned State Attorney for 
5 
the respondent has attacked the applicant’s affidavit for failure to name the 
prison officer who served him but in the circumstances of our prisons, it is 
difficulty for the prisoners to name the prison officer who served them as 
they are attended by the officers on rotation. On the issue of failure to 
account for each day of delay, he submitted that such requirement cannot 
apply in the circumstances of prisons and if the court will consider such a 
requirement, it will be technically defeating justice.  
Rejoining on the assertion that there is no illegality pinpointed by the 
applicant, he argued that, illegality is claimed where there are no other 
reasons for the delay. That there is another reason which has been stated, 
thus the issue of illegality is not necessary to be stated. He insisted that 
the applicant was not negligent in pursuing the appeal. That he managed 
to file the notice of intention to appeal within time considering that there 
are templates in the prisons but preparation of petition of appeal is a 
process which requires more time. Lastly, he prayed for this court to be 
guided by the decision made in the case of Yusuf Hassan vs Republic 
(supra) and grant the prayers sought in this application.    
I have keenly considered the submissions of both parties, the 
supporting and opposing affidavits along with the records of the court. This 
6 
application has been made under section 361(2) of the Criminal Procedure 
Act (supra). Indeed, the provision accords this court with discretionary 
powers to extend time whenever there is good cause. It provides that:  
“The High Court may, for good cause, admit an appeal 
notwithstanding that the period of limitation prescribed in this 
section has elapsed”. 
Therefore, the vital issue for determination in this application is 
whether the applicant has adduced good cause to move this court to 
exercise its discretionary powers to allow an appeal to be lodged out of 
time. As stated by the respondent’s learned State Attorney, what amounts 
to good cause is neither defined nor listed by the law and it is determined 
basing on the circumstances of each case. However, there are factors 
which have been established through case law which are considered in 
determining whether or not good cause has been shown. Those factors 
include, the length of the delay involved, the reasons for the delay, the 
degree of prejudice, if any, and whether there is a point of law of sufficient 
importance such as the illegality of the decision sought to be challenged. 
Those reasons were accentuated in the case of Lyamuya Construction 
Company Ltd vs Board of Registered Trustee of Young Women's 
Christian Association of Tanzania (Civil Application No. 2 of 2010) 
7 
[2011] TZCA 513 (3 October 2011) and William Ndingu @ Ngoso vs 
Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 3 of 2014 (unreported).  
However, the Court of Appeal in the case of Ally Salum Saidi 
(Administrator of the Estate of the late Antar Said Kleb) vs Iddi 
Athman Ndaki (supra) which was referred by the respondent’s learned 
counsel in his submission, the Court categorically stated the list of factors 
to be considered in granting an application for extension of time. It was 
stated that:    
“The list is not exhaustive. However, it is now settled that the court 
must consider certain factors depending on the peculiarity of each 
case placed before it.”   
In the instant application, the reason advanced by the applicant is 
failure to secure assistance to file his appeal from the prison officers. That, 
the applicant had an intention to file his appeal which was exhibited by 
filing the notice of intention to appeal. However, he failed to file his appeal 
on time on account that, there was no legal assistance from the prison 
officers. He argued that, his breakthrough came when his relatives visited 
him in prison. As a result, they aided him by hiring an advocate who 
assisted him by filing this application. The same learned advocate 
represented him at the hearing of the application before this court. The 
8 
respondent has resisted the applicant’s claim on the ground that, there is 
no proof that the applicant’s failure to file his petition of appeal was due to 
lack of assistance from the prison’s officers. That, he has not mentioned 
the name of his relatives who assisted him to get the service of the 
advocate and the advocate hired by his relative.  
I have considered the contending submissions from both parties. 
Firstly, I have noted that, the applicant is an inmate with limited control of 
his affairs. The control of his affairs depends much on the prison 
authorities. The applicant has depicted that he was facing a situation which 
rendered him unable to file his petition of appeal within the prescribed 
time. In short, the applicant encountered factors beyond his control. The 
practice of this court and the Court of Appeal has been that factors beyond 
the applicant’s control may be considered to be good causes in an 
application for enlargement of time. This was the stance of this court in the 
case of Said Rashid Semkiwa Kangamsee & Another vs Republic 
(supra). Also, the Court of Appeal in Foreign Mission Board of 
Southern Baptist Convention vs Alexander Panomaritis (1984) TLR 
146 and Benezeth Mwebesi & Two Others vs Baraka Peter, Misc. 
Civil Application No. 46 of 2019. 
9 
Also, in Rhobi s/o Kitang'ata Chacha vs Republic, Criminal 
Application No. 58 of 2023, this court cited the case of Maneno s/o 
Muyombe & Another vs. Republic (Criminal Appeal 101 of 2007) 
[2011] TZCA 132 (TanzLII)  where it was state that: 
“Being inmates serving time in prison, the appellants invariably had 
no control over their affairs and that they were necessarily at the 
mercy of the Officer-in-Charge of their prison, as it were. In this 
regard, it was to expect too much from them.” 
From the authority cited concerning consideration of inmates’ 
applications, I am persuaded by the applicant’s advocate view that, one, 
the applicant is a prisoner, two, filing his appeal depended wholly on the 
prison officers, third, it was upon his relative’s visitation to the prison which 
revealed that the appeal was not filed and helped him to hire an advocate. 
From legal view point, the hired advocate found that, the appeal was 
already out of time and as a result he filed this application. These facts 
cannot be easily ignored. The respondent’s learned counsel has argued 
that, the applicant in his affidavit has failed to name his relatives and the 
advocate who was hired to assist him. I find it difficult to grasp such an 
argument considering that, the applicant was represented by an advocate 
in this application and his name was known before the hearing of this 
10 
application. It was not revealed whether the advocate was not the one who 
assisted the applicant as per his affidavit. Although, I have perused the 
chamber summons in this application only to find that it was drawn and 
filed by Mr. Augustino Mahenge, advocate who represented the applicant at 
the hearing. Also, as stated earlier herein above, the applicant is an inmate 
and he could not conduct himself like any other citizen. Thus, the fact that 
the applicant’s advocate was hired upon his relative’s visitation in prison is 
also relevant. Consequently, the contents of the 4th, 6th and 7th paragraphs 
of the applicant’s affidavit show clearly that, the applicant was not 
negligent in pursuing his appeal. It was the situation which succumbed his 
efforts. I am convinced that the applicant has given good and sufficient 
cause for the extension of time within which to file notice of intention to 
appeal and an appeal out of time. 
From the foregoing, the application has merit and it is hereby 
granted. The applicant to file his notice of intention to appeal and the 
appeal within 10 days from the date of this ruling. 
It is so ordered.
