# My-Rag-model
This is the project for making a Rag model
This project helps those with issues in making a proper rag project. 
in the project you should create a data folder where you will put all your data which are 
to be used for your project. Make sure you install all dependencies such as cromadb, landchain-community, dotenv, flask.
you can just install them by writing in the command line pip install "name of dependency"
Also very important work in virtual environment


Place your data into the data directory. Also in your .env file add your api key (For this project i used deepseek api key) place your api key after you created it in the 
deepseek platform. Make sure you pay for that api before request it in your project, otherwise it will give you errors.
